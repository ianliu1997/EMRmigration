# EMRmigration

This repository contains legacy Silverlight (.NET) code under `ori_sys/code` and
an initial skeleton for a modernized stack:

- `frontend/` – React application created with Vite
- `backend/` – Django project exposing a simple API

The new code is a starting point for migrating modules such as
`SearchResultList` into React components and Django REST APIs.
